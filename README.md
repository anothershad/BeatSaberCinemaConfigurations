# BeatSaberCinemaConfigurations
#### This is a compilation of all of my Cinema configs across [my Cinema maps](https://beatsaver.com/playlists/59231)

Everything in this repo is free to use, just give me credit! Find something you want that isn't here? I probably forgot to put it here, doesn't hurt to ask!

# **How To Use:** 

#### Prerequisites

I recommend something like Visual Studio Code with a json formatting extension to make your life significantly easier. I personally use FracturedJson, which you can install in the Visual Studio Code extensions marketplace.

#### How to import into your map

1. Open your maps Cinema-video.json in a text editor of your choice.

2. Copy "environment" and everything inside of it into your own cinema-video file. Preferably, it should go under everything in your Cinema config for cleanliness sake. It doesn't have to, but it's what I recommend if you want to dive into Cinemas environment editing further.

3. Open in game and/or the official editor to check if your config works.
4. Done! A config you got from this repo should be applied to your map.

<sub> This environment really doesn't need many edits, and the edits shown above are (mostly) implemented into the mod itself already. You do not need these for a Cinema map in the FOB environment.<sub>



#### The platforms below come with good default settings through the mod itself:
 > BigMirror 
 
 > PyroEnvironment (Fall Out Boy)
