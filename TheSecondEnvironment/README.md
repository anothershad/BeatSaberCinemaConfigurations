# The Second Environment

#### As used in my G4L map.

## Changes to base game:

* Deactivates the central ring in the middle
* Enlarges the small lights on the ring to fill the old physical space of the innter ring
* Disables track construction 
* Vastly enlarges the outer rings. 
* Disables the front chevron behind the video.

*<sub>the large rings are very bright with these modifications. please do not overbrighten them or strobe them as doing so will result in personal kneecap removal.<sub>*
