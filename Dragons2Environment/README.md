# Dragons2 Environment

#### As used in [High Tide](https://beatsaver.com/maps/31301)
## Changes to base game and Cinema inbuilt configuration: 

* Removes surrounding construction
* Moves top spotlights down (This does mean they clip if the bottom squares go high enough, but so be it.)

<sub>every element isn't on in the platform, but frankly I can't be assed to look for one in this map with everything on, or create a full preview video. If you want to see the platform in action, you can watch in Zen Mode or at this link [here](https://youtu.be/JrxE7gMV1vU)
