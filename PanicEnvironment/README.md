# PanicEnvironment

#### As used in In Too Deep, mapped and lit by [monstor](https://beatsaver.com/profile/4234636)

## Changes to base game and Cinema inbuilt configuration: 

* Disables top cones
* Disables second ring with no lights
* Enlarges ring
* Enlarges lasers
* Enlarges 1st spectrogram
* Move windows to the side of the video (This doesn't move the bloom for some reason, and I'm not about to figure out why)

*<sub> I am yet to make a map for myself with this config, mostly because I can't find a video that would work well in Panic and wouldn't work in any V3 environment. Soon?<sub>*
