# PyroEnvironment

#### As used in Violet, Reincarnation, Non-Fiction, Astrogirl, and Behavior.

This repo has the choice between Astrogirl and a general config. The Astrogirl config increases the size of the light groups on the bottom, but that's about it. They both build on the Cinema mods built in config and remove the fugly screens and player setup.

## Changes to base game and Cinema inbuilt configuration: 

* Removes the screen setups that (might as well) block half the fucking platform.
* Removes the player setup that blocks the rest of what you can see. 
* (In Astrogirl) Enlarges the bottom light groups on top of the stage.

*<sub> If you couldn't tell, I hate this platform when its unmodified. It truly looks awful and claustrophobic, and with just 2 elements removed, that feeling goes away. Removing the screen elements also enables you to put nicer effects on the stage and have them actually seen, and removing the player setup enables you to put nicer effects onto the light panels. <sub>*
